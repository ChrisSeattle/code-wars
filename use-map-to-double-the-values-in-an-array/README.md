# Code Wars - Use map() to double the values in an array

## Description from Code Wars: 
Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.
