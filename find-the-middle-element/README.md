# Code Wars - <!-- paste title here -->
## Description from Code Wars: 
As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

## Process: 
I worked on this with Brandon Fenty for the whiteboard portion, then we split up to work on our own solutions.
