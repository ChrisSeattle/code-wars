# Code Wars - My head is at the wrong end!
## Description from Code Wars: 
* Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

## Process: 
* Tara Johnson and Chris Chapman worked together at the whiteboard to work out the problem domain, algorithmn, visual, and pseudo-code.
