# Code Wars - Nice Array
## Description from Code Wars: 
A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1 in the array.

Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns true if its array argument is a Nice array, else false. You should also return false if input array has no elements.
