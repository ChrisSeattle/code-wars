# Code Wars - Disemvowel Trolls
## Description from Code Wars: 
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

## Process: 
I worked on this with Nick Di Pietro for the whiteboard portion, then we split up to work on our own solutions.
