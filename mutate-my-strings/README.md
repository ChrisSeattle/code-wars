# Code Wars - Mutate My Strings

## Description from Code Wars: 
I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.

Example: 
stringOne = 'bubble gum';
stringTwo = 'turtle ham';

Result:
bubble gum
tubble gum
turble gum
turtle gum
turtle hum
turtle ham
